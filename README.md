<h1 id="pyrecords">PyRecords</h1>
<p>Search through 14 different stateâ€™s voting records to find your target. This was created in order to help with OSINT research and pretexting during a penetration test or a red team engagement. All you need to provide the program is a first name, a last name, and a state. If needed the program could be edited to add in search parameters such as age, city, and political party affiliation. But as of right now I do not see a need to add those.</p>
